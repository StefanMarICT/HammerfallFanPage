					<p>Formed in Göteborg, Sweden, in 1993 by guitarist Oscar Dronjak. Early line-ups included members from In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, most notably Jesper Strömblad, who continued to write songs together with Oscar and singer Joacim Cans despite leaving before the first album was released. Glory To The Brave (1997) and Legacy Of Kings (1998) cemented the band as the pioneers of modern Eighties heavy metal.</p>

			  							Born August 14th 1974, in Lindome just outside Gothenburg.<br/>
			  							I wanted to ROCK!!! Naturally, I picked up one of my fathers guitars and tried to learn the songs of my idols, like Accept, Metallica and Iron Maiden among others.
			  							<br/>I started playing with my friends and realized that most bands were looking for bass players. There were guitarist	and drummers everywhere, but no one really cared for the bass.<br/>Shortly thereafter Oscar asked if I wanted to join HammerFall, and you know the story: record deal, <i>Glory to the Brave</i>and I quit 10 years passed and I played with a couple of bands: None, DeathDestruction, Cans and Evergrey, but didnt play on any albums. When Joacim called me and asked if I was interested in rejoining HammerFall, I didnt hesitate. I never regretted that I left, but I would never forgive myself if I didnt take this chance.
